# ai-native-sdlc-discovery-demo

This is the isolated **development-test** rehearsal repository for the
`decisions-v1` discovery loop, initial ownership delivery, and a subsequent
maintenance iteration. It was prepared from the ownership-free
[source](https://github.com/huangyingting/ai-native-sdlc) at
`80cb3c30588754e39fcab792aefe89cad7d1ce85`.

The rehearsal is in progress. Scripted actions use the repository owner's
explicit authorization; they are not independent Human review, genuine Human
acceptance, or evidence of three completed live rehearsals. The linked
ownership case study below describes an earlier, separate run, not this one.
Do not reset the old demo or present its evidence as results from this run.

Demonstrations and tooling for exploring AI-native software delivery with
GitHub Copilot CLI, dynamic agent orchestration, OpenTelemetry traces, and
Issue-to-PR workflows.

## Start here

| What you want to do | Where to begin |
|---|---|
| Understand or present the completed ownership demo | [Illustrated case study](docs/brownfield-human-gated-delivery-case-study.md), then its [presentation and reproduction steps](docs/brownfield-human-gated-delivery-case-study.md#7-how-to-present-or-reproduce-the-result) |
| Run a new AI-native delivery cycle | **[Step-by-step walkthrough: start with preparation](docs/brownfield-human-gated-delivery-walkthrough.md#1-prepare-the-repository)** |
| Understand Intent/Spec/Plan gaps and improvements | [Early-stage research and implementation status](docs/ai-native-sdlc-early-stage-research.md) |
| Run only the service-desk application | [Application quick start](demos/it-service-desk/README.md) |
| Explore Copilot orchestration patterns | [Agent orchestration guide](docs/copilot-cli-agent-orchestration-patterns.md) |

For a fresh ownership run, use the ownership-free **source** to prepare a
**new isolated repository**. The existing
[completed demo](https://github.com/huangyingting/ai-native-sdlc-demo) already
has ownership; use it for inspection or replay, not as a fresh baseline.
The walkthrough is the main path. The [toolkit README](tools/brownfield-demo/README.md)
and [setup reference](docs/brownfield-human-gated-delivery.md) provide command
details and troubleshooting when that path links to them.

## Projects

- [`demos/it-service-desk/`](demos/it-service-desk/) — independent Next.js and
  SQLite service-desk demonstration.
- [`tools/trace-viewer/`](tools/trace-viewer/) — dependency-free trace model,
  renderer, composite action, and GitHub Pages client.
- [`tools/brownfield-demo/`](tools/brownfield-demo/README.md) — isolated demo
  preparation, read-only preflight, digest-bound container presentation, and
  replay from real delivery evidence.
- [`.github/`](.github/) — issue forms, workflow automation, and publishing
  adapters.

## Validate

Use Node.js 24 and run:

```sh
npm test
```

Each demo owns its dependencies and additional validation commands.

## Set up the brownfield demo

For a first run, follow the walkthrough's
[ordered operator setup](docs/brownfield-human-gated-delivery-walkthrough.md#1-prepare-the-repository):
prepare, inspect, publish, configure, then preflight. Setup alone does not
create a repository or publish its workflows.

After publishing your new repository, an explicitly single-owner preview is:

```sh
npm run setup:brownfield -- --repo OWNER/NEW_DEMO_REPO --single-owner
```

Replace `OWNER/NEW_DEMO_REPO` with that selected repository, not the source.
This previews prerequisites without changing GitHub. **Full `--apply` creates
missing managed rulesets, including protection for an unprotected `main`.**
Do not assume the target is unprotected or replace its existing policy.
The original source repository's `main` is intentionally unprotected; do not
apply full setup there without explicit agreement. See the
[setup guide](docs/brownfield-human-gated-delivery.md#run-the-setup-script)
for secure token entry, existing-Intent recovery, and remaining manual checks.
If you are the only Human reviewer, use the explicit
[`--single-owner` demo mode](docs/brownfield-human-gated-delivery.md#single-owner-demo-mode)
for the TDD Tests and Implementation PR gates without GitHub's native
independent-review requirement. New Spec/Plan reviews take place on the parent
Intent Issue and do not have that native PR restriction.

For new Intents, **Brownfield Delivery · Documents** publishes full rendered
Spec and Plan revisions on that Issue. Humans explicitly submit custom
`/sdlc revise spec` or `/sdlc revise plan` commands with feedback, then approve
the latest version with commands such as `/sdlc approve spec v2` and
`/sdlc approve plan v1`. Ordinary discussion does not run AI or approve a stage.
Revisions and approval snapshots are saved in Git before handoff to the
existing Tests/Implementation PR flow. Legacy document-PR Intents remain in
Spec/Plan PR mode; they are not automatically migrated.

The source configuration enables `specReadiness: "decisions-v1"` for newly
initialized runs. Spec review includes a discovery brief and blocking Q-n
questions. A configured Spec reviewer records an answer or explicit deferment;
each decision triggers a new Spec, clears previous Spec approval and Plan, and
must be incorporated before fresh approval. Existing runs keep their original
profile. Follow the [decision loop instructions](docs/brownfield-human-gated-delivery.md#discovery-and-decision-readiness)
and the current Issue hub, not fixed version numbers from an old rehearsal.

The workflows, including `brownfield-human-gated-delivery-documents.yml`, must
already be published on remote `main` and registered by GitHub. Setup cannot
register a missing workflow; it can enable an existing disabled workflow.
Setup also requires the trusted `runs.mjs`, `run-core.mjs`, and `state-store.mjs`
modules under `.github/brownfield-human-gated-delivery/scripts/` on remote `main`.
Document generation uses read-only Copilot CLI in Actions and additionally
requires `copilot-requests: write` and Copilot CLI entitlement; it never receives
the existing write-enabled `COPILOT_ASSIGN_TOKEN`. See the setup guide before
running this workflow; local documentation does not establish remote deployment.

For all Issue-based (`issue-v1`) runs, including existing ones after upgrade,
a verified image is **awaiting Human acceptance**, not
complete. A configured Implementation reviewer tests the exact published digest
and submits `/sdlc accept sha256:<64hex>` with observed results on subsequent
lines; the configured quorum must accept the current verification attempt.
Only that acceptance closes the Intent and removes its engineering branch.
Document and trusted run-record branches remain for replay. Run controls and
rejection are documented in the [command reference](docs/brownfield-human-gated-delivery.md#run-controls-and-human-acceptance).
Only legacy document-PR runs keep their original automatic-close behavior.

Start the presentation toolkit with `npm run demo:brownfield -- help`; use its
[README](tools/brownfield-demo/README.md) for exact commands and safety boundaries.
The [presenter runbook](docs/brownfield-human-gated-delivery-walkthrough.md#presenter-runbook-and-readiness)
requires three actual completed isolated rehearsals before claiming **Demo
Ready**. An [illustrated case study](docs/brownfield-human-gated-delivery-case-study.md)
records a completed, explicitly authorized `development-test` run, including
its real image, failures, and recovery. It does not count toward genuine Human
acceptance or the three-live-run readiness gate.
