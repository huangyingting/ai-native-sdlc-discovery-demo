# AI-native SDLC brownfield demo: step-by-step walkthrough

Use this guide to demonstrate a complete, human-gated feature delivery cycle
against the existing IT service desk. All lifecycle decisions happen in GitHub
Web. A Human must exercise the verified image before final acceptance; the
toolkit can present it locally without creating a hosted deployment.

## Start here

- **Inspect or present the existing result:** use the
  [ticket-ownership case study](./brownfield-human-gated-delivery-case-study.md)
  and its [reproduction steps](./brownfield-human-gated-delivery-case-study.md#7-how-to-present-or-reproduce-the-result).
  This is historical development-test evidence, not a new live run.
- **Run the ownership scenario from scratch:** an operator completes
  [Step 1](#1-prepare-the-repository) below, in order. Then the requester and
  configured Human reviewers follow [Steps 2 through 9](#2-show-the-existing-application).
- **Continue a configured, ownership-free run:** verify the
  [preflight checklist](#15-preflight-and-handoff), then continue at the relevant
  stage. For an interrupted run, use [run controls](#run-controls-during-presentation)
  and [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting-during-the-demo), not a new setup.

Do not reset the completed `ai-native-sdlc-demo` repository or submit the same
ownership request against its already-implemented application. Prepare a new
isolated repository from the ownership-free source instead.

The example starts with **unclear ticket ownership**. The Human writes the
Intent, AI proposes the Spec and Plan, and the Human can request as many
revisions as needed before approving the next stage.
For new Intents, the Human stays on the parent Issue for full rendered
Spec/Plan revision comments, discussion, and versioned approval commands.
Only the engineering stages use PR reviews.

```text
Human Intent
  -> AI Spec <-> Human feedback and revision
  -> AI Plan <-> Human feedback and revision
  -> AI tests: controlled Red -> Human approval
  -> AI implementation: Green -> Human approval
  -> Merge -> Publish image -> Smoke verification
  -> Human exercises exact digest -> Human acceptance -> Close Intent
```

This walkthrough describes the Issue document-review workflow. All Issue-based
(`issue-v1`) runs use final Human acceptance, including runs started before the
acceptance upgrade. Only runs using
[legacy Spec/Plan PR mode](./brownfield-human-gated-delivery.md#legacy-specplan-pr-mode)
retain automatic closure after smoke verification; they are not migrated.
Verify the new workflow is deployed on remote
`main` before a live session; this guide does not establish that it is already
deployed. Use the
[setup and policy reference](./brownfield-human-gated-delivery.md) for configuration
details. Document generation uses read-only Copilot CLI in Actions, separate
from the repository's orchestration-pattern demos and from Coding Agent's later
PR work.

## Presenter runbook and readiness

**Current evidence boundary:** the [case study](./brownfield-human-gated-delivery-case-study.md)
records a completed real workflow in `development-test` mode, not an independently
Human-accepted live rehearsal. These instructions and automated tests alone are
not deployment evidence. Do not announce **Demo Ready** until three actual
isolated runs below have completed with genuine Human decisions.

Use `npm run demo:brownfield -- help` from the root and the
[toolkit README](../tools/brownfield-demo/README.md) for exact commands.
The demo-owned [scenario manifests](../demos/it-service-desk/.github/brownfield-human-gated-delivery/scenarios/)
define the rehearsal cases; do not invent CLI flags or Issue-form selectors.

Before presenting:

1. Pin a source commit where the scenario's capability is still missing.
   Prepare it in a separate, **nonexistent** destination directory. Do not reset
   this checkout, overwrite an existing destination, or copy credentials,
   ignored files, or local SQLite databases.
2. Use a separately agreed demo repository. Preparation does not create a
   remote or publish workflows: the operator explicitly creates/selects the
   repository, publishes the reviewed source, and verifies `main` registration.
3. Explicitly update and publish configured reviewer identities for that
   repository, including Implementation reviewers used for final acceptance.
   Have those Humans present; the presenter or automation must not impersonate
   them or submit approvals on their behalf.
4. Run read-only preflight and review setup preview. Separate **configured**
   (settings/files are visible) from **ready** (runtime access, model entitlement,
   image publication, reviewer participation, and real runs have worked).
   Unknown token capabilities, billing, or runtime prerequisites remain blockers.
5. Keep the parent Intent, Actions, PR review, and digest-bound application
   presentation available. Use only toolkit-managed container cleanup. For
   offline presentation, use escaped, read-only HTML replay exported from a
   real run, clearly labeled as replay rather than a new live execution.

| Phase | Responsible role and evidence to show | Next Human action |
|---|---|---|
| Preparation | Operator: pinned baseline, explicit target repository, preflight findings | Resolve blockers and agree to any setup writes |
| Intent | Requester: editable business problem and open questions | Submit the Intent; preserve its original title/body |
| Spec | AI proposes; configured Spec reviewers read the full latest revision | Resolve questions, request revision, then approve the actual version |
| Plan | AI proposes; configured Plan reviewers check the approved-Spec link | Revise as needed; approve only when ready to freeze the contract |
| Tests | Coding Agent supplies controlled Red; configured Tests reviewers inspect assertions and evidence | Request correction or approve current-head Tests PR |
| Implementation | Coding Agent supplies Green; configured Implementation reviewers inspect preserved contracts and code | Approve current head only after required checks pass |
| Publish/verify | Trusted Actions: merged SHA, exact digest, run ID/attempt, smoke results | Wait for published verification; resolve failures without bypassing gates |
| Acceptance | Configured Implementation reviewers: observed behavior of that exact digest | Each Human accepts or rejects with real results on the parent Intent |
| Completion | Operator: accepted run, closed Intent, retained evidence and branch cleanup | Export real replay; clean up only managed presentation containers |

The three rehearsal acceptance criteria are:

| Isolated run | Additional evidence required before counting it complete |
|---|---|
| Normal delivery | Full Intent → reviewed Spec/Plan → controlled Red → Green → verified digest → Human acceptance |
| Spec change / Plan invalidation | After Spec approval and Plan publication, but **before full Plan approval**, request a Spec revision; show invalidated approvals/Plan, then approve new versions and finish delivery/acceptance |
| Recoverable failure | Observe and record a real failed Action in the isolated run, fix its cause, use the documented recovery path, then finish delivery/acceptance; do not fabricate a failure or weaken checks |

For each run retain repository/Intent URL, pinned baseline SHA, Spec/Plan
versions and hashes, Human approval commands, Tests/Implementation PRs and
heads, Red/Green job links, merge SHA, image digest, verification run ID/attempt,
acceptance observations/quorum, retained document/run branches, and replay
location. For recovery, also retain the failed run and corrective action.
Mark missing evidence **not verified**; local passing tests, screenshots of
mock results, or an old replay cannot fill the gap. If the live session fails,
pause and explain the blocker, or show a clearly identified real prior replay.

## 1. Prepare the repository

This is the first-time operator path; complete it before submitting an Intent.
Run each block separately and check its expected result before continuing.
Do not run later steps after an unexpected error.

### 1.1 Choose the source, target, and review mode

You need Node.js 24+, Git, authenticated GitHub CLI (`gh`), Docker with a running
daemon, and permission to create/administer the selected GitHub repository.
Copilot Coding Agent access, Copilot CLI entitlement in Actions, and registry
access are separate prerequisites; a successful `gh auth status` does not prove
them.

Check the local prerequisites before creating anything:

```sh
node --version
git --version
gh auth status --hostname github.com
docker info
```

If GitHub CLI is not authenticated, use `gh auth login --hostname github.com`.
Resolve missing tools, daemon access, and Git authentication before continuing.

Throughout this guide, replace these placeholders consistently:

| Placeholder | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `/absolute/path/to/source-checkout` | Local checkout of `huangyingting/ai-native-sdlc`, whose ownership capability is still missing |
| `FULL_40_HEX_COMMIT` | Reviewed source commit, copied from `git rev-parse HEAD`; not the literal `HEAD` or a short SHA |
| `/absolute/path/to/new-isolated-demo` | New directory outside the source; its parent must exist, but the destination must not |
| `OWNER/NEW_DEMO_REPO` | New GitHub repository you explicitly agree to create, not the source or an existing completed demo |
| `REVIEWER_LOGIN` | The Human who will review, with write access to the new repository |

The examples use **explicit single-owner demo mode**, where one Human performs
the reviews. Keep `--single-owner` on preparation, setup, and preflight.
For independent-review mode, omit that flag consistently and configure eligible
independent reviewers using the [reviewer reference](./brownfield-human-gated-delivery.md#configure-human-reviewers).
Neither mode authorizes an assistant to submit Human approvals.

Use an existing source checkout, or clone into a new path:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/huangyingting/ai-native-sdlc.git /absolute/path/to/source-checkout
git -C /absolute/path/to/source-checkout rev-parse HEAD
```

**Expected result:** a source checkout and a full commit SHA. Do not clone over
an existing directory or choose the completed demo's implementation commit.

### 1.2 Prepare the isolated baseline

Run from the source checkout root. No root dependency installation is needed:

```sh
cd /absolute/path/to/source-checkout &&
node tools/brownfield-demo/cli.mjs prepare \
  --source /absolute/path/to/source-checkout \
  --source-ref FULL_40_HEX_COMMIT \
  --dest /absolute/path/to/new-isolated-demo \
  --reviewer REVIEWER_LOGIN \
  --scenario ownership-standard \
  --single-owner
```

**Expected result:** a new ownership-free export with the current workflows,
selected reviewers, and `brownfield-demo-provenance.json`. It is not yet a Git
repository or a published demo. A baseline mismatch is a blocker; do not
disable fingerprint checks or delete ownership code to make it pass.
The [toolkit preparation reference](../tools/brownfield-demo/README.md#2-prepare-from-a-full-immutable-source-commit)
explains exclusions and alternate rehearsal scenarios.

### 1.3 Inspect and publish the new repository

Review the exported files, reviewer configuration, and provenance before
publishing. Provenance includes your local source path; confirm it is safe to
share. Check for secrets and local data even though preparation excludes common
sensitive paths. All commands in this subsection target the **new export**,
not the source checkout.

Before creating the remote, confirm that the account/plan supports the required
protections and Copilot features for the chosen visibility. The example uses
private visibility; choose public only deliberately, after reviewing the data
and organization policy. Do not weaken the gates to work around a plan limitation.

```sh
git -C /absolute/path/to/new-isolated-demo init --initial-branch=main
git -C /absolute/path/to/new-isolated-demo add .
git -C /absolute/path/to/new-isolated-demo diff --cached --stat
```

After reviewing the staged contents:

```sh
git -C /absolute/path/to/new-isolated-demo commit -m "Initialize isolated brownfield demo"
gh repo create OWNER/NEW_DEMO_REPO --private \
  --source /absolute/path/to/new-isolated-demo --remote origin --push
```

**This creates a private remote and pushes the reviewed export.**
If the remote already exists, stop and inspect it; do not force-push or overwrite
an existing run. Git author identity must be configured before committing.

```sh
gh repo view OWNER/NEW_DEMO_REPO --json defaultBranchRef --jq .defaultBranchRef.name
gh workflow list --repo OWNER/NEW_DEMO_REPO --all
```

**Expected result:** `main` is the default branch, and GitHub has registered the
delivery workflows, including **Brownfield Delivery · Documents**. If necessary,
set `main` as default in repository settings and wait for workflow registration.
Invite any additional configured reviewers with write access.
Publishing alone does not configure tokens, protections, or Copilot access.

### 1.4 Configure GitHub and review the setup preview

With Node.js 24+ and GitHub CLI authenticated as a repository administrator,
run from the **new isolated checkout root**, not the source checkout:

```sh
cd /absolute/path/to/new-isolated-demo &&
npm run setup:brownfield -- --repo OWNER/NEW_DEMO_REPO --single-owner
```

The first preview may exit **2** with missing settings, credentials, or manual
checks. Review every proposed change. **Full apply creates missing `main`
protection**; it is not merely a token-setting operation. Existing targets may
already be protected. Never infer policy from which repository contains this
copy of the guide, or apply setup to the original source by mistake.
Read-only preview does not write.

Create the limited automation credential using the
[token instructions](./brownfield-human-gated-delivery.md#configure-the-copilot-token).
Only after agreeing to the complete preview, use an interactive terminal:

```sh
npm run setup:brownfield -- --repo OWNER/NEW_DEMO_REPO --single-owner --apply --set-token
```

Enter the token only at the secure prompt, never in arguments, files, or chat.
If the correct secret already exists, omit `--set-token` to leave it unchanged.
Setup does not dispatch kickoff or publish local changes. By default it preserves
existing protections apart from the explicitly selected solo-mode change.
See [setup script details](./brownfield-human-gated-delivery.md#run-the-setup-script)
for permissions, partial-failure recovery, and manual checks.

The example's `--single-owner` flag concerns Tests and Implementation PRs. New Issue
Spec/Plan approvals do not have GitHub's native PR independent-review
restriction. Native PR review rules can exclude your approval when you
collaborated with Copilot. [Single-owner demo mode](./brownfield-human-gated-delivery.md#single-owner-demo-mode)
uses zero native approvals while retaining your explicit current-revision
approval through **Brownfield delivery policy**, required checks, and no
bypasses. It is not independent two-person review. The option changes only
native approval counts in existing managed rulesets; applying it may unblock
already-approved auto-merge PRs. This mode does not exempt the rest of setup:
full apply can create missing `main` protection. A ruleset-only edit is not
enough to establish that the workflows are published and registered.

| Check | Where to verify in GitHub |
|---|---|
| Current issue forms, prompts, workflows, and trusted modules are on the default branch | **Code**; `main` must include `runs.mjs`, `run-core.mjs`, and `state-store.mjs` under `.github/brownfield-human-gated-delivery/scripts/`; full setup checks them |
| Documents is registered and enabled | Publish `brownfield-human-gated-delivery-documents.yml` to remote `main`; GitHub must register it. Setup can enable an existing disabled workflow, not register a missing one |
| Copilot Coding Agent is available and allowed to work in this repository | Repository/organization Copilot settings |
| Copilot CLI can generate documents in Actions | `copilot-requests: write`, CLI entitlement, and any organization CLI billing policy |
| Issues, sub-issues, Actions, and Packages are available | Repository tabs and settings |
| Pull-request auto-merge is enabled | **Settings > General > Pull Requests** |
| `brownfield-human-gated-delivery:intent` exists | **Issues > Labels** |
| `COPILOT_ASSIGN_TOKEN` is configured | **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions** |
| `it-service-desk-demo` exists | **Settings > Environments** |
| Human reviewers are configured | [Delivery configuration](../.github/brownfield-human-gated-delivery/config.json) on `main` |
| Required checks and review rules are enforced | **Settings > Rules > Rulesets** |
| Trusted automation can write `brownfield-documents/**` and `brownfield-runs/**` | No conflicting PR-required ruleset; no bypass is granted |

Use the [token instructions](./brownfield-human-gated-delivery.md#configure-the-copilot-token)
for the automation credential. Generation never receives that credential or
other repository write credentials; trusted publication and approval are
separate steps. Human reviewers sign in to GitHub normally; they do not need
to create a token to review documents or PRs.

The source configuration assigns `huangyingting`; preparation replaces reviewer
lists with the selected `REVIEWER_LOGIN`, while preserving approval thresholds.
Inspect and publish the actual configuration for your run. Final acceptance
uses the Implementation policy and quorum, not a separate configurable stage.
Submitting the Intent does not automatically make its author a reviewer.
For mandatory approval by one particular end user, configure that person as
the sole Spec and Plan reviewer with a threshold of one. Issue approvers must
be current configured Humans with repository write access, including current
members of configured teams. Bots cannot approve. Do not lower
`minimumApprovals` for single-owner mode.

Check the [ruleset instructions](./brownfield-human-gated-delivery.md#configure-branch-rulesets):

- Both `brownfield-delivery/**` and `main` require
  `Brownfield delivery policy` and `stage-validation`.
- `main` also requires `validate` and `container-smoke`.
- Dismiss stale approvals, require conversation resolution, and do not allow
  humans or automation to bypass the gates.
- Exempt initial lifecycle-branch creation from status checks so the approved
  document handoff can create it; keep subsequent updates protected and allow
  cleanup only after Human acceptance for Issue-based runs.
- Managed rulesets cover only `main` and `brownfield-delivery/**`, not
  `brownfield-documents/**` or `brownfield-runs/**`. State branches need trusted
  automation writes, not a ruleset bypass.

### 1.5 Preflight and handoff

From the new isolated checkout, after resolving setup findings:

```sh
cd /absolute/path/to/new-isolated-demo &&
npm run setup:brownfield -- --repo OWNER/NEW_DEMO_REPO --single-owner &&
node tools/brownfield-demo/cli.mjs preflight --repo OWNER/NEW_DEMO_REPO --single-owner
```

**Expected result:** setup's automated checks pass and preflight reports
`automatedReady: true`. Its `readyForLiveRun` remains `false` because the tool
does not certify manual checks. Verify credential scope/expiry, entitlement,
billing, Docker daemon and registry access, and reviewer participation yourself.
Stop on unresolved blockers. Do not use fresh-baseline preflight to evaluate a
completed ownership implementation; use replay for that.

**Configured when:** the form is visible, intended reviewers are configured, and
automation prerequisites and agreed branch protections are in place. This is
not yet **Demo Ready**; complete the real rehearsals above. Hand off to the
requester and reviewers at [Step 2](#2-show-the-existing-application), then create
the Intent in **`OWNER/NEW_DEMO_REPO`**, not in the source or completed demo.

## 2. Show the existing application

Explain the starting point using the
[IT service desk overview](../demos/it-service-desk/README.md):

- tickets already support creation, search, status changes, and filtering;
- data is persisted in SQLite;
- ticket ownership is the missing capability for this example.

Optionally, from the repository root with Node.js 24 or newer:

```sh
cd demos/it-service-desk
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>. Show an existing ticket and the queue before any
feature work begins. Do not delete existing ticket data.

**Explain:** this is brownfield development. The goal is to improve an existing
system while preserving its current behavior, not generate a replacement.

## 3. Submit the human-authored Intent

1. Open **Issues > New issue**.
2. Choose **Brownfield human-gated delivery: Submit an intent**.
3. Review the prefilled title: **[Brownfield delivery] Clarify ticket ownership**.
4. Review or edit all five fields:

   | Field | What the Human supplies |
   |---|---|
   | Problem or opportunity | Why unclear ownership makes handoffs difficult |
   | Proposed outcome | How agents and team leads should benefit |
   | Affected users and systems | The people and existing application involved |
   | Constraints and non-goals | Preserve current data/workflows and keep scope small |
   | Open questions | Decisions that need discussion during Spec review |

   Include the source of the problem observation, known success measures,
   and smaller alternatives where possible. Explicitly say "unknown" instead
   of inventing user research or performance/business metrics.

5. Leave genuine uncertainties visible. For this example, the form asks whether
   tickets may be unassigned, how owners are selected, and whether filtering
   by owner is needed.
6. Click **Create** and record the new Intent Issue number.

The submitting user must be an `OWNER`, `MEMBER`, or `COLLABORATOR`.
Do not select a Copilot CLI demo form or manually assign all lifecycle stages.

**Expected result:** one parent Intent Issue with the
`brownfield-human-gated-delivery:intent` label. There is no AI-written Intent
stage and no separate Intent approval gate.
Check the Issue's **Labels** immediately. If the label is absent, confirm it was
created in the repository, apply it to this Issue, and follow the manual kickoff
recovery below. GitHub does not create labels from the form definition.

Once document review starts, the Intent's title and body are snapshotted.
Do not edit them afterward: Documents rejects changes to that original request.
Use explicit revision-command feedback to refine the documents, or create a
new Intent for a changed original request.

## 4. Verify automatic kickoff

1. Open **Actions > Brownfield Delivery · Kickoff**.
2. Open the run associated with the Intent and wait for it to complete.
3. Confirm it routes the new Intent to **Brownfield Delivery · Documents**.
4. Return to the Intent Issue and inspect its current review hub.

You should see:

- a `brownfield-documents/<intent-number>` branch;
- a separate `brownfield-runs/<intent-number>` branch for trusted operational
  state, with workflow-bot ledger attestation;
- a current hub on the parent Issue, linking the latest document versions and
  their review status;
- a full rendered Markdown **Spec v1** revision comment after generation and
  trusted publication succeed; new source-configured `decisions-v1` runs
  also show a discovery brief and any blocking Q-n questions;
- possibly four internal stage issues: Spec, Plan, TDD Tests, and
  Implementation, with no Spec/Plan Coding Agent assignment.

Stay on the parent Intent. A completed kickoff run does not itself mean Spec
generation and publication have finished; inspect the Documents run too.
For a new Intent there should not yet be a `brownfield-delivery/<intent-number>`
branch or a Spec PR.

**Expected result:** read-only Copilot CLI generates the first Spec; trusted
automation validates and saves the revision in Git, then publishes the full
document for Human review on the Issue. No application build runs.

## 5. Review and iterate on the Spec

1. Wait for Documents to publish the first full Spec revision comment.
2. Use the parent Intent's hub to locate the latest version and read it.
3. Check that it describes the intended outcome, scope, non-goals, actors,
   constraints, and stable Given/When/Then acceptance scenarios.
4. Review open questions and proposed decisions. Ordinary Issue comments are
   available for discussion; they do not execute AI or approve the document.

Each revision is saved under
`docs/delivery-runs/brownfield-human-gated-delivery/<intent-number>/` on the
document branch as `spec.md`, with review state in `document-review.json`.
The full comment is the reading surface, and the Git revision is durable
evidence. New `decisions-v1` runs also enforce recorded-decision readiness.
There is no Spec PR or application test, build, or container job.

### Resolve discovery questions first

The source configuration enables `specReadiness: "decisions-v1"` only when a
new run is initialized. Its version-2 document state preserves that choice.
Existing version-1 runs keep their original structural-only review; changing
configuration does not upgrade them or disable readiness on version-2 runs.
Confirm the profile in the hub before choosing the applicable commands.

For a new discovery run:

1. Read the brief: problem, evidence or unknowns, success measure, alternatives.
   Check it against the actual Intent rather than treating AI's wording as fact.
2. Inspect every Q-n item marked **BLOCKING**. As a configured Spec reviewer,
   answer one question with the current version and actual question ID:

   ```text
   /sdlc decide spec v1 Q-1
   Outcome: Tickets may remain unassigned until triage.
   Rationale: New requests arrive before a responsible agent is known.
   ```

3. Wait for a new Spec revision. The decision itself does not approve anything.
   Read the changed behavior and its decision-to-AC mapping.
4. Answer the next question against that new version, or explicitly defer it
   with the required rationale, owner, follow-up, and risk fields described in
   the [decision command reference](./brownfield-human-gated-delivery.md#discovery-and-decision-readiness).
5. Only after the hub has no unanswered blockers, review and approve the
   actual current Spec version using the ordinary approval command below.
   Deferred questions remain visible risks, not resolved facts.

For the prefilled ownership Intent, useful decisions include optional versus
mandatory ownership, fixed roster versus free text, and whether filtering is
needed. Do not assume AI will assign these the same Q-n IDs in every run.
If it missed an important question, request a Spec revision that adds it.
Ordinary comments or `/sdlc revise spec` feedback cannot substitute for a
recorded disposition of an already registered question.

To demonstrate the gate, first attempt approval while a real blocker remains.
Expected result: an explicit rejection, no Plan, and no engineering assignment.
Then record an authorized decision and demonstrate the resulting revision and
fresh approval. This is a rehearsal script, not a claim of completed live
Human review. Never submit decisions on behalf of another reviewer.

### Request ordinary document changes and approve

For a deliberate first feedback round, submit the following as a **new
top-level comment on the parent Intent**, with the command on its first line:

```text
/sdlc revise spec
For this demo, tickets may remain unassigned. Use the scenario's fixed local
owner roster, Avery Stone and Jordan Lee, and include filtering by owner.
Preserve existing tickets and workflows. Make these decisions explicit in
the specification for re-review.
```

This is example revision feedback, not requirements automatically imposed by
the Intent form. In a discovery run, first record the corresponding question
decisions using the steps above; feedback alone does not clear their blockers.
Adapt the example to the feature and decisions you actually want.

This is a custom repository Actions command, not a built-in `@copilot` command.
Post the text itself, not a quoted example or fenced block. Wait for Documents
to publish the next Spec version (**v2** only if you started from v1), then:

1. Read the full revised document and inspect the changes against your feedback.
2. If further clarification is needed, submit another revision command:

   ```text
   /sdlc revise spec
   Clarify the behavior for invalid owner selections and unassignment, and explain
   how invalid updates preserve stored ticket data. Add the missing acceptance
   scenarios for re-review.
   ```

3. Repeat until the Spec is acceptable and open decisions are resolved or
   explicitly deferred. Discovery decisions can increase the version several
   times; use the current hub, not this example's version numbers.
4. If **v2 is still the latest version**, submit this new top-level comment:

   ```text
   /sdlc approve spec v2
   ```

   If you requested another revision, use its actual latest version instead;
   a stale-version approval is rejected.

**Expected result:** the approval is recorded in Git with the document
version/hash, decision-context hash for discovery runs, approving command
comment ID/body, and Human ID/login/time, not a
separate immutable rendered-revision comment snapshot. After the configured
threshold is satisfied, Documents generates
Plan v1 linked to the approved Spec. There is no Spec PR to merge.

### The rule for every review round

- Keep the same parent Intent and document branch throughout document review.
- Submit new top-level `/sdlc` comments explicitly; ordinary discussion,
  `@copilot` mentions, and edits to existing comments do not trigger this flow.
- Only the latest version is approvable, by current configured Humans with
  write access. Team membership and `minimumApprovals` still apply; bots cannot
  approve. There is no native PR independent-review restriction here.
- A comment saying "looks good," checklist changes, or successful generation is
  not approval. There is no automatic approval timeout. Discovery runs allow
  at most 20 questions and 100 decision receipts; oversized context/history
  fails explicitly rather than being truncated.
- Editing or deleting a processed approval comment does **not** revoke its
  Git-recorded decision. Submit an explicit revision before handoff instead.
- Revising Spec before handoff invalidates all Spec approvals and the draft or
  approved Plan, including its approvals. A new Spec review and new Plan
  version are required.
- Full Plan approval freezes the documents. Do not approve it while a Spec
  change is still needed.
- Commands are durably queued and reconciled on each run. If a pending run is
  superseded or execution fails, resume Documents; do not assume comments were
  lost or create a replacement Intent.

## 6. Review and iterate on the Plan

1. Follow the latest full **Plan v1** revision comment from the parent hub.
2. Confirm its linked Spec is the version you approved.
3. Review its open questions and proposed approach.
4. Check that:
   - every approved acceptance scenario maps to at least one task;
   - task IDs and dependencies are clear and acyclic;
   - affected code surfaces and validation are specified;
   - existing-data compatibility, migration risks, and scope are addressed.
5. Confirm this stage has not changed the approved Spec or written application
   code or tests.

As with Spec, Plan runs document/scope and approval validation, not application
builds or container checks. It is saved as `plan.md` with review state on
`brownfield-documents/<intent-number>`.

If improvement is needed, submit a new top-level parent-Issue comment:

```text
/sdlc revise plan
Refine this plan into small, dependency-ordered tasks for storage
compatibility, server-side behavior, UI changes, and regression coverage where
required by the approved Spec. Map each task to acceptance scenarios and explain
its validation. Preserve the approved specification.
```

Repeat review and revision until satisfied. If no Plan revision was needed and
**v1 remains latest**, submit:

```text
/sdlc approve plan v1
```

If you used the revision command above, wait for the new Plan and approve that
version instead (for example `/sdlc approve plan v2`). Do not approve an older
version merely to follow this example.

If planning exposes a problem with the approved Spec, use `/sdlc revise spec`
with feedback **before fully approving the Plan**. This invalidates Spec
approvals and the existing Plan. Review and approve the new Spec, then the new
Plan version. The Plan must not silently rewrite approved requirements.

**Expected result:** after the latest Plan has all configured Human approvals,
automation freezes `spec.md`, `plan.md`, and `document-review.json`, creates
`brownfield-delivery/<intent-number>` from the approved document commit, closes
the internal Spec/Plan stage issues, and assigns **only TDD Tests** to Coding
Agent. The next review surface is a Tests PR. After this handoff, contract
changes need a new Intent rather than editing approved artifacts.

## 7. Review the TDD Red evidence

1. Open the TDD Tests PR. Its base should still be the lifecycle branch.
2. Inspect the new tests and
   `docs/delivery-runs/brownfield-human-gated-delivery/<intent-number>/expected-failures.json`.
3. Confirm test names map to approved acceptance scenarios and the assertions
   describe real behavior rather than unconditional failures.
4. Confirm production code and approved `spec.md`, `plan.md`, and
   `document-review.json` blobs are unchanged.
5. Open the **Brownfield Delivery · Stage CI** run and inspect the `tdd-red`
   job and its summary.

The evidence must show:

- existing baseline tests pass;
- the new feature tests run and fail exactly as declared;
- lint and build pass;
- no unrelated collection, setup/teardown, or runtime errors are accepted as Red.

**Important:** the feature tests are intentionally Red, but the
`stage-validation` check must pass. Its success means the workflow verified
the expected failures. Do not approve a broken validation job.

Request corrections in the same PR if needed. When the tests and evidence are
sound, explicitly approve the latest revision.

**Expected result:** approved tests merge into the lifecycle branch, not
`main`. The workflow then assigns Implementation. The approved test files
become an immutable contract for that implementation.

## 8. Review the implementation and Green checks

1. Open the Implementation PR after Copilot finishes its initial work.
2. Confirm the coordinator has retargeted it to `main`. It contains the complete
   increment: Spec, Plan, document approval state, tests, and implementation.
3. Review the code against the approved artifacts.
4. Confirm approved tests and lifecycle artifacts have not been weakened,
   edited, deleted, or renamed. Additional tests may be added in new files.
5. Inspect the required results:

   | Required status/check | Evidence |
   |---|---|
   | `stage-validation` | Approved contracts preserved; expected Red tests now Green |
   | `validate` | Application tests, lint, and production build pass |
   | `container-smoke` | The production container starts and passes smoke checks |
   | `Brownfield delivery policy` | Configured Humans approved the current revision |

6. Request revisions with `@copilot` if the implementation is not acceptable.
   New commits require another Human review.
7. Approve the latest revision only when behavior and code meet the agreed Spec.

For a visual demonstration, validate the behavior selected during Spec review,
including existing-ticket compatibility. A generic dashboard smoke test does
not prove every feature acceptance scenario; inspect the feature tests too.

**Expected result:** the approved, passing PR auto-merges into `main`. The
parent Intent remains open pending delivery verification.

## 9. Verify delivery and accept the result

1. Open **Actions > Brownfield Delivery · Publish** for the merged PR.
2. Inspect the `publish` job for the image build and GHCR publication.
3. Inspect the `verify` job for:
   - pulling and running the published image by its immutable digest;
   - a successful `/api/health` response;
   - the dashboard smoke check;
   - stopping the temporary container after verification.
4. Return to the parent Intent Issue and read the current verification evidence:
   digest, merge SHA, Actions run ID, and attempt. Smoke success leaves this
   new Intent **open, awaiting Human acceptance**.
5. Use the [toolkit](../tools/brownfield-demo/README.md) to present that exact
   digest. Each configured Implementation reviewer exercises the approved
   scenarios, including existing-ticket compatibility. A dashboard smoke test
   alone does not prove ownership behavior or other feature requirements.
6. Each eligible reviewer submits a new, unedited, top-level Intent comment
   after publication, replacing the digest and observations below:

   ```text
   /sdlc accept sha256:<64hex>
   <Scenarios actually exercised, observed outcomes, and any limitations.>
   ```

   Do not paste placeholders or claim a UI test not performed. To reject, use
   `/sdlc reject sha256:<64hex>` with actual failure observations instead.
7. Confirm the configured Implementation quorum has accepted the **current**
   verification. Only then should the Intent close and the engineering
   `brownfield-delivery/<intent-number>` branch be removed. Retain
   `brownfield-documents/<intent-number>` and `brownfield-runs/<intent-number>`
   for replay.

**Expected result:** a traceable chain from the human-authored Intent through
approved artifacts and tests to a published, verified image digest and recorded
Human acceptance bound to its merge SHA, run ID, and attempt.

Before completion, reverification invalidates collected acceptance even if the digest stays the same;
each reviewer must inspect the new published evidence and decide again.
Rejection blocks acceptance until another verification attempt. For a code or
scope defect after merge, create a linked remediation Intent; never edit the
sealed Spec/Plan or approved tests to erase the disagreement. Do not declare a
rejected run complete. Legacy document-PR runs alone keep smoke-success closure.
An already accepted run is terminal; another delivery requires a new Intent.

The `it-service-desk-demo` Environment records temporary container verification.
It does **not** create a permanently hosted application or public demo URL.
An application already running on your machine is not automatically upgraded.
Use the exact verified digest for acceptance and the after-demo UI tour.
Cleanup must target only toolkit-managed presentation containers, not unrelated
local workloads.

## Completion checklist

- [ ] Human submitted the Intent.
- [ ] Full Spec revisions, discussion, and explicit commands are visible on the parent Intent.
- [ ] Humans approved the latest Spec version before Plan started.
- [ ] Full Plan revisions on that same Issue link the approved Spec.
- [ ] Humans approved the latest Plan before TDD started; approvals and document hashes are saved in Git.
- [ ] Documents froze and the delivery branch was created from the approved document commit.
- [ ] Only TDD Tests was assigned at engineering handoff.
- [ ] Controlled Red evidence was validated and approved.
- [ ] Implementation passed Green tests, build, and container checks.
- [ ] Human approved the implementation before it merged.
- [ ] Published image digest and smoke-verification run are recorded on the Intent.
- [ ] Configured Implementation reviewers exercised the exact digest and submitted actual observed results after the current verification.
- [ ] Current acceptance meets quorum and binds digest, merge SHA, run ID, and attempt.
- [ ] Intent closed only after Human acceptance; engineering branch removed, document/run branches retained.
- [ ] Real evidence and replay were retained; only managed presentation containers were cleaned up.

## Run controls during presentation

The Documents workflow routes run controls. Writers submit `/sdlc help`,
`/sdlc status`, `/sdlc pause`, `/sdlc resume`, or
`/sdlc cancel` as new, unedited, top-level Human comments on the Intent.
Pause/cancel gate future work, leave PR policy pending, and disable auto-merge.
This includes future document publication, publish resolution, and stage
advancement.
They **do not terminate agents/workflows already running or undo merges**.
Cancellation is terminal and retains Issues, PRs, and branches; continuing
requires a new Intent. Resume releases a pause, not a failed-job retry.
See the [command reference](./brownfield-human-gated-delivery.md#run-controls-and-human-acceptance).

## Troubleshooting during the demo

Follow this failure decision tree before retrying:

1. **No kickoff or workflow?** Check published `main`, GitHub registration,
   labels, and authorization. Resolve prerequisites; setup cannot publish or
   register a missing workflow.
2. **Document generation/publication/handoff failed?** Fix the cause, then
   `/sdlc retry` or dispatch Documents for the same Intent. Keep sealed state
   intact if full Plan approval already happened.
3. **Engineering CI failed?** For a real defect, request a same-PR correction
   and re-review. For infrastructure failure, fix it and rerun that failed CI
   Action. Do not treat an unrelated failure as controlled Red.
4. **Advance or Publish failed?** Inspect that exact failed Action, fix its
   cause, and rerun its failed jobs (or whole run if needed). `/sdlc retry`
   cannot recover these; there is no automatic infinite rerun loop.
5. **Verification passed but completion is blocked?** Inspect pause/cancel,
   rejection, current digest/run/attempt, decision timing, reviewer eligibility,
   and quorum. Obtain genuine fresh Human acceptance, never a synthetic one.
6. **Code/scope defect after merge, or cancelled run?** Preserve evidence and
   create a linked new Intent. Do not reset branches or rewrite sealed artifacts.

| Symptom | What to check or do |
|---|---|
| Form is missing or has old content | Confirm the template is on the default branch; open a fresh **New issue** form |
| Documents is missing from Actions | Publish the reviewed workflow to remote `main` and wait for GitHub registration. Setup cannot register a missing workflow; it can enable one already registered but disabled |
| Kickoff did not start | Check the Intent label and author association. Adding a label later is not a kickoff trigger; use **Actions > Brownfield Delivery · Kickoff > Run workflow** with the existing Intent number |
| Kickoff failed partway through | Fix the reported prerequisite, then dispatch Kickoff with the same Intent number; do not create duplicate Intents just to retry |
| Documents rejects a changed Intent title/body | The original request is snapshotted at startup. Keep it unchanged; use revision-command feedback for refinements or a new Intent for a changed original request |
| An ordinary comment or `@copilot` mention did not revise the document | Expected: submit a new top-level `/sdlc revise spec` or `/sdlc revise plan` with feedback on the parent Issue; discussion and edited comments do not run the command interface |
| Document generation failed | Check the Documents run, `copilot-requests: write`, CLI entitlement/billing, and Actions policy. Fix the cause, then submit `/sdlc retry` or manually dispatch Documents with `issue_number` |
| A pending run was replaced, or publication/approval/handoff failed | Resume Documents for the same parent Issue; its durable queue reconciles submitted commands on every run. Do not repost commands just because their original run was superseded |
| Issue approval did not advance | Check the exact latest version, current configured Human login/team membership, repository write access, and `minimumApprovals`; bots cannot approve |
| Deleting or editing an approval comment did not revoke it | Expected for a processed approval snapshot. Request an explicit revision before full Plan approval; after handoff, use a new Intent |
| A Spec revision invalidated the Plan | Expected: reapprove the new Spec, then review and approve a new Plan version; old Spec/Plan approvals cannot be reused |
| Trusted automation cannot write its state branch | Inspect rules matching `brownfield-documents/**` and `brownfield-runs/**`. Allow trusted writes without granting a bypass; managed rulesets cover only `main` and `brownfield-delivery/**` |
| Required attested document/run branch is missing | Stop and inspect original ledger/history; missing state fails explicitly and must not be recreated to reset approvals |
| Documents reports run-control or cleanup failure | Read that phase's failure, fix the cause, and rerun the failed Documents Action; it is not necessarily a document-generation error |
| Acceptance is recorded but Issues remain open after a merge-evidence error | Inspect the actual PR `merged` timeline event and its `commit_id`; REST API `2026-03-10` omits `merge_commit_sha` from PR responses. Preserve the recorded decision and sealed documents. After deploying a fix, dispatch Documents on updated `main` with the same `issue_number` to reconcile cleanup; do not duplicate approvals or substitute the current main tip |
| An existing Intent still uses Spec/Plan PRs | This is [legacy mode](./brownfield-human-gated-delivery.md#legacy-specplan-pr-mode), not a failed migration. Keep its PR workflow |
| Copilot did not revise a Tests, Implementation, or legacy document PR | Submit the review, then post a direct `@copilot` request in that PR and inspect the agent session |
| Copilot finished but its PR is still a draft | Check the **Copilot cloud agent** run and final response, not just draft state. Review its scope, request corrections as needed, then mark it ready for review. This is not approval; the exact current head still needs the configured review and required checks |
| Copilot says its progress tool cannot edit mandatory PR metadata | An authorized operator can restore the four `Delivery Demo`, `Delivery Intent`, `Delivery Stage`, and `Delivery Stage Issue` lines from the assigned stage Issue and remove closing keywords. Verify the actual Intent, stage, and base branch first; never invent metadata to reclassify unrelated work. Recheck Stage CI and policy afterward |
| Copilot PR workflows or Review Signal end with `action_required` | Review the code and workflows before authorizing execution. Use GitHub's approval UI, or have an authorized operator rerun the specific run with `gh run rerun RUN_ID --repo OWNER/REPO` and verify its new attempt executes. The REST approval endpoint for fork PRs can return 403 for Copilot-created runs. Do not disable required workflow approval, treat `action_required` as success, or replace the independent PR review with workflow authorization |
| PR approval did not unblock policy | Check configured reviewer identity, current-head approval, outstanding change requests, and draft state. Review Signal and PR Coordinator run asynchronously; inspect their latest runs |
| PR policy passed, but GitHub rejects approval from a Copilot collaborator | Native PR rules need an independent person with write access. For a one-Human demo, use [single-owner mode](./brownfield-human-gated-delivery.md#single-owner-demo-mode); do not remove the policy or stage checks. This restriction does not apply to Issue approvals |
| Required PR policy/check never appears | Confirm the Review Signal, PR Coordinator, and Stage CI workflows are installed and enabled, and that rulesets use the exact required names. New Issue documents do not wait for these PR checks |
| Stage check failed | Read the failing job and request a correction in the same PR; do not weaken the validator or approve an unrelated failure |
| Classification rejects a generated `Fixes` suffix | The updated coordinator repairs only Copilot's recognized closing reference to the current stage Issue, then body-edited CI reruns. Ensure the compatibility fix is on the default branch; unrelated closing references still need correction |
| Approved PR has not advanced | Check run pause/cancel state, required checks, conversations, branch freshness, auto-merge, and whether the PR actually merged. Inspect **Advance**; fix the cause and rerun that failed Action, not `/sdlc retry` |
| Publish or smoke verification failed | Read the actual Publish run. Fix infrastructure failures before **Re-run failed jobs**; report code defects through a linked new Intent. A new verification invalidates previous acceptance |
| Smoke passed but Intent remains open | Expected for every Issue-based run, including existing runs after upgrade: exercise the exact verified digest and obtain configured Human acceptance quorum |
| Accepted digest was rejected or reverified | Another verification is required after rejection, and fresh acceptance is required after reverification; old comments cannot accept a future attempt |

To recover document generation/handoff only, without new feedback, post this as a new top-level comment
on the existing parent Intent:

```text
/sdlc retry
```

Alternatively, open **Actions > Brownfield Delivery · Documents > Run workflow**,
select `main`, and supply that parent Issue's number in the manual
`workflow_dispatch` input `issue_number`. The equivalent command, replacing the
repository and example number as needed, is:

```sh
gh workflow run brownfield-human-gated-delivery-documents.yml \
  --repo OWNER/NEW_DEMO_REPO --ref main -f issue_number=7
```

Inspect the latest hub and run result after recovery. A full Plan approval
keeps documents frozen even if branch creation or the Tests assignment must be
retried.

If the delivery Environment has an additional approval rule, its reviewer must
also release the pending verification job. Keep the original Intent open while
delivery is failing; do not close it merely because implementation merged.

For another run, choose a feature still missing from the current baseline.
After ownership has been delivered, submitting the same ownership Intent again
is not a meaningful brownfield demonstration. Use a separately prepared demo
repository from the pinned baseline for repeatable rehearsals instead of
deleting application data or undoing unrelated work. See the
[readiness criteria](#presenter-runbook-and-readiness) before reporting Demo Ready.
