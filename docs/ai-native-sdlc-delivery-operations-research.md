# Build, Verify, Deploy, and Operate: Research and Demo Improvement Design

Assessment date: 2026-09-28.

This complements the [Intent/Spec/Plan research](ai-native-sdlc-early-stage-research.md).
The table below is a **dated baseline**, before the three reliability loops.
The [reliability walkthrough](brownfield-reliability-loops.md) records the
implemented commands, their scope, and separately identified execution evidence.
Improvements do not retrospectively change this assessment or earlier approvals.
The [actual reliability rehearsal](https://github.com/huangyingting/ai-native-sdlc/blob/main/docs/brownfield-reliability-rehearsal.md) records
the completed local qualification and two successful fresh runtime exercises.

## Executive summary

The principal later-stage risk is not slow code generation. It is accelerating
an insufficiently verified implementation into a running environment.

Our existing demo is strongest at traceable decisions, protected contracts,
real Red/Green results, immutable delivery identity, and operator-led acceptance.
It is weaker at proving the adequacy of tests, limiting deployment impact,
recovering safely, and continuously detecting and learning from operational
failures. AI-generated explanations are not substitutes for runtime evidence.

Prioritize three small, complete loops:

1. **Trustworthy verification:** establish a passing control, deliberately
   introduce bounded behavioral defects, require assertion-based detection,
   restore the control, and test the actual delivered image under a fault.
2. **Safe release and recovery:** deny an unhealthy candidate traffic, admit a
   qualified candidate, exercise recovery, and verify persistent data.
3. **Operational feedback:** detect repeated failures, preserve sanitized
   evidence, produce a reviewable maintenance handoff, execute an authorized
   response, and measure the recovery window.

Do not start by adding a production platform, autonomous approvals, or more
code-generation agents.

## 1. Method and evidence boundaries

There is no authoritative universal ranking of the ten most common AI-specific
Build/Verify/Deploy/Operate problems. This is a qualitative prioritization for
small teams making brownfield changes through GitHub, based on impact,
recurrence in delivery practice, and the cost of discovering mistakes late.
It is not a measured frequency ranking or a numerical coverage score.

| Source | What it supports | What it cannot establish |
|---|---|---|
| DORA 2025 [S1] | AI amplifies the strengths and weaknesses of the underlying organizational system | A universal causal ranking or this demo's effectiveness |
| DORA test automation [S2] | Fast, reliable tests, developer ownership, realistic journeys, and intolerance of flaky feedback | That passing a particular suite proves semantic completeness |
| Google SRE release engineering and canarying [S3, S4] | Reproducible artifacts, controlled rollout, observable release evaluation and recovery | Production safety of an isolated Docker exercise |
| Google SRE monitoring and postmortems [S5, S6] | User-visible symptoms, actionable signals, evidence-based diagnosis and preventive follow-up | That a readiness endpoint constitutes an SLO or an on-call system |
| DORA database change management [S7] | Data changes must be versioned, coordinated and evaluated across environments | That reverting an image reverses a schema or restores data |
| NIST SSDF 1.1 [S8] | Secure development belongs throughout the lifecycle | That this repository implements every framework practice |
| Repository code and actual rehearsal receipts [E1] | Specific implemented mechanisms and observed outcomes | Independent Human approval, production incidents or long-term business value |

The baseline is source commit `0bade0d1189c8e435ebf74789d33912409a983bf`
and completed discovery-demo documentation commit
`66847955b04560b1fa7d701d7f2c306ba1429400`.
The accepted readiness application came from merge
`d361ce032b0f729f62b165c23c4f79bb56f29b92`.
All associated rehearsals were explicitly `development-test`.

## 2. Ten high-impact pain points

"Strong within scope" describes an exercised mechanism, not an eliminated risk.
"Partial" means relevant support exists but material gaps remain.

| # | Pain point | AI amplification | Baseline coverage and remaining gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Compiling code that violates intended behavior or scope.** Build | Plausible additional logic is produced faster than it can be reviewed. | **Partial.** Approved Spec/Plan, stage boundaries and exact-head review constrain changes, but do not automatically establish semantic correctness. Review caught unnecessary exception mutation in the readiness implementation. |
| 2 | **Environment drift, unreliable feedback and irreproducible builds.** Build / Verify | Generated code assumes the wrong runtime/dependency behavior; retries can hide rather than resolve failures. | **Partial.** Independent lockfiles, `npm ci`, Node 24, Docker and real CI exist. The base image is a mutable tag, Node's patch version is not fixed, and systematic flaky-test governance is absent. A shared-host timeout occurred during rehearsal. |
| 3 | **False confidence from tests that do not detect incorrect behavior.** Verify | Implementation and tests can share the same mistaken assumption, overuse mocks, or assert only existence. | **Partial.** Exact Red, run/hook-error rejection, frozen tests, real SQLite and browser checks help. A missing-route assertion nevertheless hid deeper harness defects until implementation. |
| 4 | **Regressing old behavior, persistent data or nonfunctional requirements.** Verify | A narrow happy path dominates attention; concurrency, compatibility and capacity are omitted. | **Partial.** Existing tests, migration preservation, persistent ownership and non-mutation checks exist. Fifty passing tests do not establish load, concurrency, performance budgets or comprehensive NFR coverage. |
| 5 | **Functional success with security or supply-chain risk.** Build / Verify | Unnecessary dependencies, insecure code and excessive tool privileges can spread quickly. | **Foundational only.** Scoped workflow permissions, some sanitization and non-root runtime exist. A complete exercised SAST/SCA, image scan, SBOM, signing, verification and admission chain was not established. This is a capability gap, not a finding of an exploitable vulnerability. |
| 6 | **Reviewing A, testing B and running C.** Verify / Deploy | A generated completion summary or mutable tag can be mistaken for evidence. | **Strong within the demonstrated scope.** Exact-head review, frozen Git blobs, digest pulls and digest-bound acceptance are checked against actual records. CI and post-merge publication still perform separate builds; there is no complete multi-environment build-once promotion system. |
| 7 | **Deploying without controlled exposure or safe recovery.** Deploy | Deployment instructions omit traffic control, configuration compatibility, persistent state and recovery prerequisites. | **Production-grade capability not established.** Isolated immutable containers are available, but no canary, traffic switch, release abort, previous-version rollback or backup/restore drill was demonstrated. Cancelling an Intent does not roll back a workload. |
| 8 | **Confusing a live process with user-visible availability.** Operate | A successful health probe or generic HTTP 200 becomes a false success signal. | **Specific fault addressed; broader capability partial.** Readiness distinguishes usable storage from liveness, but continuous monitoring, SLI/SLO, alerting and traffic admission are absent. Automated publish verification still checks health and dashboard, not readiness. |
| 9 | **Detecting failure without enough evidence to diagnose and recover.** Operate | Fluent root-cause guesses can outrun logs, metrics and actual runtime observations. | **Partial.** CI records, delivery receipts, fixed generic failure logs and a runbook exist. Request/release correlation, diagnostic packets and on-call workflows do not. The Trace Viewer observes agent execution, not complete production application behavior. |
| 10 | **Repairing symptoms without owned, verified prevention.** Operate to Build | An agent finishes the immediate fix and omits follow-up, recurrence and outcome review. | **Basic loop exercised.** Operational observation became a new Intent, delivery and same-digest acceptance. Automatic incident intake, owned preventive deadlines, recurrence measures and long-term business results were not demonstrated. |

## 3. What the real failures taught us

### Frozen tests prevent changing the answer, not choosing the wrong answer

The first readiness maintenance attempt produced valid missing-route Red.
Green exposed two test-harness defects: a mock returned from `beforeEach` was
treated as cleanup, and an existing SQLite observer retained stale column
metadata following another connection's migration.

The response was cancellation and a new reviewed continuation, not modification
of frozen tests. An isolated, explicitly labelled harness experiment then
proved that the corrected suite could pass a candidate implementation.
It was not stage Green or permission to edit production code in the Tests stage.

A later review found exception sanitization that mutated caught errors.
Supplemental tests using frozen errors failed, the unnecessary mutation was
removed, and actual Green was rerun. Passing the original assertions had not
proved that boundary safe.

### Identity consistency is necessary, but not deployment safety

Digest-bound acceptance proves which image was exercised. It does not prove
that the release can safely replace a production version or recover compatible
configuration and data. A known old image is not a database restore strategy.

### Readiness is an operational input, not a complete operating model

The final image returned exact 503/no-store/unavailable readiness with unusable
storage while liveness remained 200. That distinction is intentional.
The missing capability was using that distinction automatically for admission,
monitoring and response. The rehearsal's fifty successful readiness probes
were a bounded observation, not a long-term availability claim.

## 4. Three implementable slices

| Slice | Decisive evidence | Explicit boundary |
|---|---|---|
| Trustworthy verification | Original suite passes; each chosen behavioral mutant is caught by assertions rather than a broken runner; restored suite passes; healthy and faulted instances of the same digest meet exact HTTP contracts | A bounded qualification of selected readiness tests, not universal mutation coverage or proof of all acceptance criteria |
| Safe release and recovery | Read-only loopback traffic remains on the good release after rejection; a qualified candidate receives traffic; rechecked fallback restores service without losing controlled fixture writes | A same-image configuration/process recovery rehearsal; no cross-version migration, write-traffic replication, production canary or backup/restore claim |
| Operational feedback | Repeated samples open one incident; an authorized response runs; a sustained healthy window verifies recovery; evidence produces an owned, reviewable maintenance task | No automatic GitHub publication/approval, no fabricated root cause, and no claim that symptom recovery completes preventive work |

Preserve the ownership-free source application. Reuse the accepted readiness
image and exact completed-demo source for these exercises rather than copying
finished features into the baseline. Never attach accepted demonstration volumes
to fault injection. Never change old lifecycle evidence.

Security/supply-chain admission remains a parallel follow-up. These slices do
not replace security verification, load testing, independent reviews, actual
customer validation or production operational ownership.
