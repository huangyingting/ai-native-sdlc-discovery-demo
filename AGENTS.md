# Repository instructions

## Scope

This repository contains independent demonstration applications, reusable
tools, GitHub workflow automation, and documentation.

- Keep complete demo applications under `demos/<name>/`.
- Keep repository utilities under `tools/<name>/`.
- Keep shared workflow adapters under `.github/scripts/` and demo-specific
  automation inside that demo's `.github/<demo-name>/` directory.
- Add shared packages only when multiple projects genuinely consume them.

Demo projects are intentionally not npm workspaces. Each demo owns its
manifest, lockfile, runtime requirements, documentation, and path-scoped CI.
Do not add demo dependencies to the root package.

## Changes

- Follow the nearest nested `AGENTS.md` when a project has additional rules.
- Update workflows, scripts, tests, and documentation when moving files or
  changing a public path.
- Preserve existing behavior and compatibility unless a change explicitly
  requires otherwise.
- Avoid over-engineering. Prefer the simplest design that fully satisfies the
  current requirement, and do not add abstractions, dependencies, or extension
  points without a demonstrated need.
- Do not commit generated build output, local databases, logs, or credentials.
- Keep changes focused and follow the style already used in the target project.
- For Brownfield Human-Gated Delivery stage work, follow the assigned prompt
  under `.github/brownfield-human-gated-delivery/prompts/`. Do not change
  approved lifecycle artifacts or production code outside the current stage's
  allowed boundary.

## Validation

Use Node.js 24 unless a nested project documents another supported runtime.

Run repository automation and trace-viewer tests from the repository root:

```sh
npm test
```

For the IT service desk:

```sh
cd demos/it-service-desk
npm test
npm run lint
npm run build
```

Run the smallest relevant checks while iterating, then run the complete checks
for every project affected by the change.
